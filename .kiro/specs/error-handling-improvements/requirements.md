# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on implementing comprehensive error handling, monitoring, and user experience improvements for the IELTSpeak application. The current codebase has basic error handling but lacks consistency, proper user feedback, retry mechanisms, and comprehensive monitoring. This improvement will enhance application reliability, user experience, and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Centralized Error Handling System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized error handling system so that all errors are consistently processed, logged, and reported.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in any part of the application THEN the system SHALL capture it through a centralized error handler
2. WHEN an error is captured THEN the system SHALL log it with appropriate context (user ID, timestamp, stack trace, request details)
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL categorize it by type (network, validation, authentication, server, client)
4. WHEN a critical error occurs THEN the system SHALL send alerts to monitoring services
5. IF an error is user-facing THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate user-friendly messages

### Requirement 2: API Error Handling Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent and informative error messages when API calls fail so that I understand what went wrong and what I can do about it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API endpoint encounters an error THEN it SHALL return standardized error responses with consistent structure
2. WHEN a validation error occurs THEN the API SHALL return detailed field-level error messages
3. WHEN a rate limit is exceeded THEN the API SHALL return appropriate 429 status with retry information
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the API SHALL return clear authentication error messages
5. WHEN a server error occurs THEN the API SHALL log the full error while returning sanitized user messages
6. IF an API call times out THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry with exponential backoff

### Requirement 3: Client-Side Error Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to gracefully handle errors and provide recovery options so that I can continue using the service without losing my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a network request fails THEN the system SHALL automatically retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
2. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the authentication and retry the request
3. WHEN a form submission fails THEN the system SHALL preserve user input and show specific error messages
4. WHEN the Vapi connection fails THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect and notify the user of the status
5. IF a critical error occurs during a speaking session THEN the system SHALL save progress and offer recovery options
6. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL detect network status and queue actions for when connection is restored

### Requirement 4: User Feedback and Loading States

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about what's happening in the application so that I know when actions are processing, successful, or have failed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any async operation starts THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN an operation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL show success feedback
3. WHEN an operation fails THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages with actionable next steps
4. WHEN a long-running operation is in progress THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators
5. IF an operation is taking longer than expected THEN the system SHALL inform the user and provide options to cancel or wait
6. WHEN multiple operations are running THEN the system SHALL manage loading states independently

### Requirement 5: Data Validation and Sanitization

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be properly validated so that I receive immediate feedback about any issues before submission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters data in any form THEN the system SHALL validate it in real-time
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL show specific error messages for each field
3. WHEN data is submitted to the server THEN the system SHALL perform server-side validation as a backup
4. WHEN user input contains potentially harmful content THEN the system SHALL sanitize it appropriately
5. IF required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL prevent submission and highlight missing fields
6. WHEN file uploads occur THEN the system SHALL validate file types, sizes, and content

### Requirement 6: Session and Authentication Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless authentication handling so that I don't lose my work when my session expires or authentication issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic token refresh
2. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL redirect to login while preserving the intended destination
3. WHEN authentication is required for an action THEN the system SHALL prompt for login and return to the original action
4. WHEN a user is logged out due to inactivity THEN the system SHALL save any unsaved work locally
5. IF multiple tabs are open THEN the system SHALL synchronize authentication state across tabs
6. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on resolution

### Requirement 7: Performance Monitoring and Error Tracking

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive monitoring and error tracking so that I can proactively identify and fix issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL track them with full context in Sentry
2. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL monitor and alert on key metrics
3. WHEN API response times exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL log performance warnings
4. WHEN user actions fail repeatedly THEN the system SHALL flag potential issues for investigation
5. IF error rates spike THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts to the development team
6. WHEN new errors are detected THEN the system SHALL categorize and prioritize them automatically

### Requirement 8: Graceful Degradation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to continue working even when some features are unavailable so that I can still access core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI suggestion service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue the session without suggestions
2. WHEN the rating service fails THEN the system SHALL save the session data and allow manual rating later
3. WHEN third-party services are down THEN the system SHALL provide alternative functionality where possible
4. WHEN database connections fail THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns
5. IF payment processing is unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue payment attempts and notify users
6. WHEN external APIs are slow THEN the system SHALL implement timeouts and fallback responses
